      I am a retired Vietnam Veteran.
      <br />
My campaign is simple: I plan on collecting signatures to send to the Governor to plea that Veterans play for free or perhaps just pay for a cart fee. I will also campaign for private golf courses to allow Veterans play at least 1 round of golf at their prestigious clubs. Most Veterans can not afford clubs like Metedeconk National Golf Club, Deal Country Club, Hollywood Country Club, just to name a few. Remember Veterans deserve our thanks for their loyalty to our country.
New Jersey has some of the best public golf courses in the United States, Veterans shouldn't have to pay full price!
